  - ML:  ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, UAI, JMLR, ICLR
  - AI:  AAAI, IJCAI
  - IR/DM: SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, WWW

- We are interested in a broad range of NLP/AI topics, for example, (a list [here](https://slack-files.com/T22T1UP8Q-F726RJERH-9a39cc3d9a))

  - syntactic/semantic parsing
  - entity/relation/event extraction
  - distributed/distributional/compositional semantics
  - MT/QA/Dialog
  - (deep) learning algorithms

- Tutorials of top conferences, high quality surveys are welcome.

## For Presenters

- Please fill your slots in the [Agenda](#agenda) **at least one week** before your presentation.

  - Please format Paper fields with *[venue+year]title* (e.g. [ACL18]A Good Paper).
  - Please upload your slides, and add links to them in Slides fields.
- Besides technical novelties, please give enough background knowledge in case people are unfamiliar with your topic.
- It would be great to keep your presentation within 60 min.

## For Audiences

- Please read abstract/introduction sections before the seminar.
